# MadLibs
## Unit 4 from course Native App Studio

This app is a blind fill-in game. It contains five pre-made stories with a few blanks. The user of the app
is prompted to provide these words by only hinting to them the type of word. After all the words are 
provided, the story is displayed.
This app supports both landscape and portrait orientation.
